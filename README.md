# Titanic-Machine-Learning-Model
Machine Learning model for the famous Titanic Kaggle Competition.
The required parameteres are optimised using Feature Engineering and the Survival of Passengers are predicted using Linear Model (Logistic Regression), Decision Tree Classifier, KNeighbors, Naive Bayes, Support Vectors along with ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Classifier.
The accuracy of the resulting predictions are furthur improved by using a Voting Classifier.
